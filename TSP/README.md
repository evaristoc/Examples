Testing python code for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), mainly:
- at http://www.psychicorigami.com/ by J. Montgomery (search TSP); also https://github.com/lilspikey/TSP
- at "Python Algorithms", pp 262, M. L. Hetland (apress)

Few customising modifications for python 3.x to handle the file formats for the "Discrete Optimization" course at coursera.com (https://www.coursera.org/course/optimization) by prof P. van Hentenryck.
Data for the course can be also found at:
https://github.com/zjsxzy/Courses/tree/master/Discrete%20Optimization/Programming%20Assignments/tsp/data

Some code lines of the python tsp.py solver resemble the initial python file provided at the aforementioned course.

Relevant Information (some is still work in progress):
- Code is made in python 3.3 and works only for Linux-like OS
- Code would include all the modules in one single module instead of several ones to simplify installation
- Code doesn't contains any notes or comments for a more clean file (not for clarity)
- Code includes a simple test for the file given by J. Montgomery at his website
- It was proposed for downloading selected data files from github into the current working directory and deleting the file after completing the task
- In order to avoid long running times, a constraint was included to handle selected data files with no more than 100 records
- To avoid additional incompatibilities no code for figures would be included
- A few lines for numpy are included but the code could easily modified to exclude the use of this module
 
Specific information could be found at aforementioned references.
