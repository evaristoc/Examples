BIG DATA

Exercise related to a training.The learning dataset was provided.

The code involves Machine Learning techniques to classify gene sequences in a blind dataset using an existing training dataset.

Techniques:
1) Preselection of the most relevant genes (in concordance with information theory, elemental genetic biology)
2) Similarity functions

(The data and the code are currently under revision to make them less customised to my personal needs)
