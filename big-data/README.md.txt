BIG DATA

Exercise related to a training.The learning dataset was provided.

The code use Machine Learning techniques to classify gene sequences in a blind dataset using an existing training dataset.

Techniques:
1) Preselection of the most relevant genes (information concepts, genetic theory)
2) Similarity functions

(The data and the code are currently under revision to make them less customised to my personal needs)
