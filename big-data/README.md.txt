BIG DATA

Exercise related to a training.The learning dataset was provided in the course.

The code use Machine Learning techniques to classify gene sequences in a blind dataset based on a provided training dataset.

Techniques:
1) Preselection of the most relevant genes (information concepts, genetic theory)
2) Correlations 

(The data and the code are currently under revision to make them less customised to my personal needs)
